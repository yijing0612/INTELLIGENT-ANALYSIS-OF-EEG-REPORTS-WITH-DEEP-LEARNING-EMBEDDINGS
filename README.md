# INTELLIGENT-ANALYSIS-OF-EEG-REPORTS-WITH-DEEP-LEARNING-EMBEDDINGS

The typical process of analysing and grouping patients based on Electroencephalography (EEG) records requires extensive domain knowledge and is time-consuming. This study proposed the utilization of EEG medical reports to streamline this process through the application of deep learning embedding techniques for intelligent analysis. The primary aim is to demonstrate the efficiency of deep learning embeddings in solving several down-streaming tasks including classifying, modelling topics, and retrieving relevant medical records from EEG medical reports using advanced approaches.

The study employs several methodologies, including the use of Bi-LSTM for pseudo-labelling classification and BERTopic for topic modelling. Notably, the findings indicate that the embedding based BERTopic significantly outperforms traditional Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) in terms of coherence and relevance of topics generated. Additionally, this study introduces a novel embedding-based neural ranking model for document retrieval, integrating General Text Embeddings (GTE) and Meta Llama3 for retrieval augmented generation (RAG) based Text-To-Table Application.

The proposed solutions achieved high performance metrics, indicating their efficacy in handling the complexity of medical text data. Furthermore, expert evaluations by neurologists corroborate the utility and accuracy of the system in clinical settings.

This work contributes to the field of Electronic Health Record (EHR) by providing a comprehensive framework for the intelligent analysis of EEG reports, which could potentially enhance diagnostic study process and patient care. <br>
